# Plasma

> Centralized, reactive configuration server built for highly complex and connected data

## Features

* Write your configuration in whatever structure you want
* Consume it with simple, intuitive HTTP requests
* Use Javascript to describe your configuration as you see fit (yaml support eventually)
* Configuration changes get propagated to subscribers

## TODO

- [ ] Websocket endpoint
- [ ] Better js engine, possibly [go-duktape](https://github.com/olebedev/go-duktape)
- [ ] Better babel support (user configurable support, babel 7)
